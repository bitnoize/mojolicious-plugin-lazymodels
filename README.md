Mojolicious::Plugin::LazyModels
===============================

Expandable Mojolicious Data Model on top of awesome PostgreSQL.

Goals:

- Separate readwrite and readonly database connections.
- Basic boolean, numeric, text and uuid data type validators included.
- Completely asynchronous code with Promises.
- No restrictions on query build logic, it's just a plain Perl.
- Automatic migrations with schema definitions.
